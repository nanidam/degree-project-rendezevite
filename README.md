# Rendez Evite

This application is the culmination of my degree project for school, aiming to simplify the event planning process and provide users with an intuitive and collaborative experience.

RendezEvite simplifies the task of managing guest lists, allowing users to effortlessly organize and keep track of attendees. Choose from a selection of currently two templates to create invitations that reflect the essence of your event. Stay up-to-date with your event's attendance through RendezEvite's real-time RSVP system. Easily track responses, making it simple to plan for the number of attendees. 

The application sends invitations automatically to your guestlist. Guests receive secure access to the invitation through a unique link and password, enhancing the overall security of the platform.

    3. Choose between of our templates.
